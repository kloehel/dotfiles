# README

To automatically install everything, just execute the install.sh script.
Take a look at this script since it might perform some actions that are
not of your satisfaction. Anyways, by default this script takes care of
initializing and updating submodules (in my case, I keep the vundle repo as
a submodule). Vim plugins will also get installed automatically.

Notice though that in MacOS X the user should install the GNU coreutils
package. In order to do this you should perform the following command:

    $ brew install coreutils

And that's about it. Use this at your own risk ;)
